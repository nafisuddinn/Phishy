Phishy AI analyzes any message (e.g. Instagram DM, SMS, or email) and tells you:
- ✅ Whether it’s likely a scam
- 🧠 The type of scam (phishing, impersonation, etc.)
- 📊 A confidence score from 0–100%
- 📄 A short explanation of why it’s flagged
- 📜 Shows the user's history of analyzed messages
- 🌐 Community threat feeds, shows the latest scams happening now!
- 🗺️ Heatmap to show the concentration of scams occuring in specfic areas
